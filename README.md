`Note: This is not Law. You are welcome to suggest and edit these rules and raise a Pull Request`

### Priority levels
* The rules will have a priority level. but given that we are humans and mistakes can be possible, and lets admit it, we are lazy, The rules are are mandatory are starred (*) the ones in starred are taken very strictly, and not following them might concern all other people living in the apartment.

### The rules are divided into 3 subcategories.

# Kitchen
* We should not store anything in kitchen that gives any strong odour or which considerable lowers the hygene by encouraging flies, insects, viz. 
* If we use a utensil, which is either your personal item or a publicly shared item, it is `NOT` mandatory to clean it up the next moment. How ever, if it is a publicly shared item, it is better to clean it up within 2-3 days.
* The Most important rule in kitchen is the way we handle uncleaned utensils. 

`the following rules that follow numbering are very important with highest priority`

**1. Do not leave utensils with organic matter in it. You can leave the utensil uncleaned, but before leaving, throw the organic waste like left out curries, edible items, onion peels, any thing which you could assume that the dispencer would take care off.
2. if you have cooked something, unless and untill anybody promises you that they would, `YOU` are responsible for cleaning the utensils used.
3. It is recommended to reduce and reuse to lower burden on yourself. Special focus and attention must be given to how you place the vessels to be cleaned in the sink. Reduce the space used, and avoid blocking the drain. see the pictures in the following link to see which way is better.
4. This is usually not a written rule, but highly important: When ever you clean something using the `scrub`, always, `ALWAYS` rinse it under water and fully squeeze it so water is not retained and bad odour and microbes don't spread.

* We must undeerstand that we are not saints, and we are definitly lazy, so, we don't have to clean things like pan for chapathi, or other no greasy stuff.
