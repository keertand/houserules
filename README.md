# HOUSE RULES
`Note: This is not Law. You are welcome to suggest and edit these rules and raise a Pull Request`

### Priority levels
* The rules will have a priority level. but given that we are humans and mistakes can be possible, and lets admit it, we are lazy, The rules that are mandatory will be in bold. The ones in bold are taken very strictly, and not following them might concern all other people living in the apartment.

### The rules are divided into 3 subcategories. 
`Note: Any images or videos used can not be claimed for copyright as they are used for no profitabe cause.`
# Kitchen
* We should not store anything in kitchen that gives any strong odour or which considerable lowers the hygene by encouraging flies, insects, viz. 
* If we use a utensil, which is either your personal item or a publicly shared item, it is `NOT` mandatory to clean it up the next moment. How ever, if it is a publicly shared item, it is better to clean it up within 2-3 days.
* The Most important rule in kitchen is the way we handle uncleaned utensils. 

### the following rules in numbering are very important with highest priority

1. **Do not leave utensils with organic matter in it. You can leave the utensil uncleaned, but before leaving, throw the organic waste like left out curries, edible items, onion peels, any thing which you could assume that the dispencer would take care off.**
2. **if you have cooked something, unless and untill anybody promises you that they would, `YOU` are responsible for cleaning the utensils used.**
3. **It is recommended to reduce and reuse to lower burden on yourself. Special focus and attention must be given to how you place the vessels to be cleaned in the sink. Reduce the space used, and avoid blocking the drain. see the pictures in the following link to see which way is better.**
4. **This is usually not a written rule, but highly important: When ever you clean something using the `scrub`, always, `ALWAYS` rinse it under water and fully squeeze it so water is not retained and bad odour and microbes don't spread.**

* We all know that we are not saints, and we are definitly lazy, so, we don't have to clean things like pan for chapathi, or other non-greasy stuff.(Omlet/dosa if they stick to the pan must be washed)

# Bedrooms
* Bedroom is your personal room. But so is it for other who share it with you. So, the least we can do is keep unwashed/ dirty laundry in a specific place, not spread them out.
`I am not going to live in the bedroom, so i dont have much thoughts on it, but you are more than welcome to share your thoughts. thank you`

# Bathroom
* In a bachelor's apartment with more than 3 people using the same washroom, there needs to be strict persistence for hygiene.
the follow are MANDATORY during bathroom usage
1. **We may not have OCD, so we don't bother about things like spilling on the mirror when brushing. And it is not that important also, as its not something that is a priority issue.**
2. **But, the toilet seat is a sacred place, and we must worship it. Let's face it, we will be pissing while standing, and thats how god made us, but something will definitely spill on th toilet seat even if can not see it. So, after we piss, just take a small piece of toilet paper and swipe the seat and flush it off.**
3. **To Clarify, by toilet seat, i did not mean the raisable hinged seat, because that SHOULD DEFINITELY be rested back while pissing.**
4. **Everybody should proabably take turns in cleaning our washroom once a fortnight, or we can do the smart thing, use it such that we dont have to clean it**


# conclusion
We may not be able to keep our house clean and perfect, but if you read the above rules, it is evident that it following these rules can help us maintain our mess and reduce load on us while cleaning, and will encourage us to keep our ~~house~~ home that way.
